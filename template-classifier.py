#Acquire the data in an accessible format
#Identify and correct missing data points/anomalies as required
#Prepare the data for the machine learning model
#Establish a baseline model that you aim to exceed
#Train the model on the training data
#Make predictions on the test data
#Compare predictions to the known test set targets and calculate performance metrics
#If performance is not satisfactory, adjust the model, acquire more data, or try a different modeling technique
#Interpret model and report results visually and numerically
