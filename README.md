# ml-supervised-learning-classification-randomforest

This is a starters implementation of RandomForest classification algorithm on one of the standard datasets made available with sklearn library in python. In the end code finds out the following

- Features Importance
- Out of Box feature score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) - lower the better
- Confusion Matrix - look out for non-diagnoal values, for a good classifier they should have small values
- Accuracy score - generally speaking, higher the better
- Recall score - generally speaking, higher the better
- F1 score - good measure of model performance, higher the better
- Precision score - generally speaking, higher the better

--------Sample Output---------
- Feature Importance is  [0.09248343 0.01973311 0.45551099 0.43227247]
- Out of box features score is  0.9732142857142857
- Mean absolute error (MAE)  0.05
-[[11  0  0]
- [ 0 10  2]
- [ 0  0 15]]
- Accuracy score is 0.9473684210526315
- Recall score is 0.9473684210526315
- Precision store is 0.9535603715170279
- F1 score is 0.9466208133971291
